# Game Design — Core Mechanics

Project: ColorQuest  
Issue: Game design — Core mechanics

1. Overview
- Short description: ColorQuest is a prototype puzzle-platformer where the player navigates levels by matching and manipulating colors. Color interactions change world elements (platforms, doors, hazards) and unlock progression.
- High-level goal: Validate core loop — movement + color interaction — and deliver one playable level demonstrating progression and win condition.

2. Player goals & loop
- Player goal: Reach the level exit by using color mechanics to traverse obstacles and solve puzzles.
- Core loop:
  1. Observe level and color-coded elements.
  2. Change or match a color (player ability / collectible).
  3. Use altered world state to move forward (jump, push, open).
  4. Repeat until exit reached.

3. Core mechanics (detailed)
- Movement
  - Walk left/right, jump, crouch (if needed).
  - Basic physics: acceleration, variable jump height (hold to jump higher), simple friction.
- Color states
  - Player and world objects have color states (e.g., Red, Green, Blue).
  - Default palette: Red, Green, Blue (expandable).
- Color change ability
  - Method A (preferred for prototype): Player can switch their active color instantly (key press / UI).
  - Method B (alternate): Player picks up color orbs that temporarily grant a color state.
- Color interactions
  - Match-to-activate: An object activates when the player's current color matches the object's color.
    - Example: A Red platform becomes solid only when player is Red.
  - Paint-to-change: Player can paint certain objects to change their color (consumes resource or has cooldown).
  - Combine/Overlay (optional advanced): Certain objects respond to combinations (e.g., Red+Blue = Purple) — skip for MVP.
- Interactive elements
  - Color Platforms: Solid only for matching color.
  - Color Doors: Open when player matches or paints the door color.
  - Color Switches: Toggle target objects when activated by matching color.
  - Hazardous Color Zones: Damage player if colors mismatch.
  - Movers / Blocks: Blocks that slide or rotate when activated (by matching color).
- Resource / limitations
  - If switching is unlimited, balance via level design.
  - If using color orbs or cooldowns, include UI indicators and small timers.

4. Controls (suggested)
- Keyboard:
  - A / D or ← → : Move left / right
  - Space: Jump (hold for higher jump)
  - S or ↓ : Crouch / interact
  - 1 / 2 / 3 : Set active color (Red / Green / Blue)
  - E : Interact / paint (if painting mechanic implemented)
- Gamepad mapping:
  - Left stick / D-pad: Move
  - A (or bottom face): Jump
  - X / Y / B or shoulder buttons: Cycle colors
  - Right bumper: Interact / paint

5. Progression & difficulty
- Early tutorial area introduces:
  - Movement, single-color platform, door.
- Mid section adds:
  - Multiple colored elements, moving blocks, timing challenges.
- Late section (end of single level):
  - Combine actions: timing + color switching to pass synchronized obstacles and reach exit.
- Difficulty curve: Teach → Combine → Test under pressure.

6. Level design guidelines (one playable level)
- Start area: Safe zone with brief text prompts for controls and color switching.
- Puzzle 1 (Tutorial): One color platform blocking a gap — switch to cross.
- Puzzle 2: Door requiring specific color; color orb placed earlier to teach orb pickup (if used).
- Puzzle 3: Moving block that becomes active only when player matches color — use to create step progression.
- Final challenge: Sequence requiring two quick color switches to pass timed hazards and reach exit.
- Victory: Reach exit + small success animation / sound and display completion time.

7. UI & feedback
- HUD
  - Active color indicator (icon + name).
  - If limited resource: orb count / cooldown timer.
  - Health bar (if hazards present).
- Visual feedback
  - Clear color tint on interactive objects when active vs inactive (e.g., full saturation when active, desaturated when inactive).
  - Particle/sound on successful color match activation.
  - Subtle outline or glow for the object the player is looking at / near.
- Accessibility
  - Colorblind mode: Use shapes/patterns or icons in addition to color to indicate states.
  - Toggle for colorblind mode in settings.

8. Art & SFX (prototype scope)
- Art: simple placeholder sprites (solid color blocks for platforms, simple player sprite with colored overlay).
- Animations: idle, run, jump; simple particle on color change.
- Audio: one jump SFX, one color-change SFX, success chime, background loop (optional).

9. Acceptance criteria (what "done" looks like)
- Player can move, jump, and change color reliably.
- At least one level where all designed color mechanics are present and required to complete.
- Interactive elements respond visually and audibly to color match.
- Level has a clear start, progression, final objective, and win state.
- Controls displayed on first load or accessible tutorial prompts.
- Project includes README (done), and branch has code/assets for prototype.

10. Technical notes & tasks (split into actionable items)
- Tech stack decision (Unity / Godot / Web): [specify]
- Tasks
  1. Implement player controller: movement, jump, animation. (dev)
  2. Implement color state system on player and objects (enum + manager). (dev)
  3. Create ColorPlatform behavior (solid when matched). (dev)
  4. Create ColorDoor behavior (open when matched). (dev)
  5. Create UI: active color indicator, tutorial text. (dev)
  6. Level layout: build designed single playable level. (design/art)
  7. Add placeholder art and SFX. (art/audio)
  8. Add colorblind mode: shapes/icons on elements. (accessibility)
  9. Playtest and adjust physics/response. (qa)
 10. Create PR with "Closes #2" and link project card. (process)
- Branch naming: `2-game-design-core-mechanics` (matches issue).

11. Metrics to evaluate prototype
- Time to complete level (target < 5 minutes).
- Number of deaths / retries (use to tune difficulty).
- Playtest feedback: clarity of mechanics, UI clarity, fun/engagement.

12. Open questions / scope decisions
- Switch vs. pick-up color mechanic? (Decision: start with instant switch for faster iteration.)
- Use health/damage or instant reset on hazards? (Decision: instant respawn to restart puzzle quickly.)
- Palette size for prototype? (Decision: 3 colors: Red, Green, Blue.)

13. Files to add in this branch

- src/PlayerController.* (platform-specific)
- src/ColorSystem.* (platform-specific)
- src/ColorPlatform.*, src/ColorDoor.*, src/ColorSwitch.* (platform-specific)
- scenes/level1.* or public/level1.html (platform-specific)
- art/, audio/ placeholders
